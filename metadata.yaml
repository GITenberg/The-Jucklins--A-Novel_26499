description: "The Jucklins is an 1896 novel by Opie Read. It was a best selling book\
  \ in the United States, (Read asserted that over one million copies were sold) though\
  \ it never appeared on the best-sellers list in The Bookman since its early and\
  \ primary sales were of cheap paperback copies sold on trains and at newsstands.\n\
  The story is set in the backwoods of North Carolina. Teacher Bill Hawes lives with\
  \ the Jucklins,a local farming family, including father Lim Jucklin, daughter Guinea\
  \ and son Alf.\nRead reported that he sold the book for $700 to publisher Laird\
  \ & Lee. He needed the cash to pay off a poker debt. A sequel of sorts, Old Lim\
  \ Jucklin was released in 1905, and consists of a \"collection of random observations\
  \ and humors in the cracker-box philosopher manner.\"\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
